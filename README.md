# StenoKonnect

**StenoKonnect** is a modern, privacy-first web portal created by Stenoip Company. It all started in 2021 as *Stenoip Wonder Computer*, with a big idea to build an operating system using just HTML. While that turned out to be a bit too ambitious, the vision shifted and grew into something even better: a single online space for productivity, entertainment and learning, all with user privacy at the heart of everything.

## About the Name

The original name, *Stenoip Wonder Computer*, was created by the founder at age 10. Although imaginative, it led to some confusion. Many assumed it was a downloadable operating system or a physical device. As the platform matured, a clearer name was needed. **StenoKonnect** reflects the site's true purpose: a place to explore and stay safe online.
