# StenoipKonnect

**StenoipKonnect** is a modern, privacy-first web portal created by Stenoip Company. It provides users with two distinct services: a customizable web portal for organizing frequently visited websites and a dedicated information hub for space exploration news and educational content. Our goal is to provide these resources while maintaining a high standard of user privacy.


It all started in 2021 as *Stenoip Wonder Computer*, with a big idea to build an operating system using just HTML. While that turned out to be a bit too ambitious, the vision shifted and grew into something even better: a single online space for productivity, entertainment and learning, all with user privacy at the heart of everything.

## About the Name

The original name, *Stenoip Wonder Computer*, was created by the founder at age 10. Although imaginative, it led to some confusion. Many assumed it was a downloadable operating system or a physical device. As the platform matured, a clearer name was needed. **StenoipKonnect** reflects the site's true purpose: a place to explore and stay safe online.
