<h1>FloorTiles Operating system</h1>

<p>This operating system removes the traditional Start menu by integrating application discovery into the standard right-click context menu. Alongside familiar actions like Copy and Paste, users can select “App Menu…”, which opens a draggable, non-modal App Menu as a normal window. </p>

<p>These App Menu windows follow the same rules as all other windows multiple instances can exist, they appear in the taskbar and they do not block multitasking—allowing users to launch applications wherever and whenever they need without a single global launcher. This keeps the taskbar focused on window management while making app discovery and consistent and great for multitasking.</p>
