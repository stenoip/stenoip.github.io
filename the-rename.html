    <h1>From Wonder Computer to StenoKonnect</h1>
    <p>Back in 2021, I named this site Stenoip Wonder Computer when I was just 10. I thought you could build an operating system with HTML (spoiler: you can't). The name was fun but kind of confusing. People thought it was a real computer or something you had to download. Now that the site has grown into a  web platform with office tools, games, media  and privacy-first features, it's time for a name that makes more sense. Say hello to StenoKonnect, your place to explore, create and stay safe online.</p>
