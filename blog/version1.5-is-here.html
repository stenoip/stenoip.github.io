      <p>
    Today, I finally finished my website. Well, not really. I am going to take a break. Every day(s) in a week, I will be constantly working on my website. Why? Well it was to develop Praterich of course? 
        <a href="https://stenoip.github.io/praterich">Praterich</a> is my very on A.I chatbot powered by the model Gemini 2.5 flash
        (I will of added GPT-4 but it requires a subscription.<br>
        You may be asking, why am I using Gemini Flash? Should I make why very own? Well first, I do not have a server
        complex in the desert like Google or OpenAI. Second, Microsoft did it with Microsoft Copilot.<br>
        Praterich was a success. She gave correct responses, was able to generate <strong>some</strong> code
        and was well smart. But, I can image in the year 2034, everyone will be able to make a chatbot. So I decided to go big.

      <p>That's right, I decided to put Praterich on Ringzauber!<br>
      It all started when I was in the shower. I thought "What does my browser have that other's don't"?
        I earlier used Google Assistant and I got an idea. What if Praterich can control Ringzauber. And so I started working.<br>
        It took a few months but I am finally finished. Most hurdles where bugs in the code. It took a long time to fix them.<br>
        Unforunately, some bugs remain. During the time I was fixing some bugs, I was saving some of my ideas for another update.<br>
        Still, I was pleased with my work. I called some friends over and they said they liked it. Hopefully, you do too.
        <br> <a href="ringzauber.html">Download here</a>. I suggest filling the Google Forms to tell me your review and how I can fix Ringzauber.
